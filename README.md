# WeatherBuddy

WeatherBuddy is a Python program that given an input zipcode will scrape weather data using the Pywapi API and return a short message with summarized weather details.  

WeatherBuddy can send email messages or text messages, and can be scheduled for a daily reminder so you can get the weather for the day as soon as you wake up.  

Build details will be up soon.
